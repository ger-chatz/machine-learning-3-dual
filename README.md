# Constrained Optimization and Lagrangian Duality in R

## Overview

This project applies techniques from **constrained optimization**, specifically **quadratic programming** and **Lagrangian duality**, implemented in **R**. It was developed as part of the MSc in Applied Statistics program and includes both theoretical formulation and practical algorithmic implementation.

---

## Objective

To solve a quadratic cost minimization problem under linear inequality constraints using:

- Lagrangian duality
- Primal-dual iterative optimization
- Projected gradient methods implemented from scratch in R

The analysis demonstrates how optimization theory can be applied algorithmically to find efficient, feasible solutions.

---

## Optimization Techniques Used

- Quadratic programming (QP)
- Lagrangian duality
- Primal-descent / dual-ascent algorithm
- Projection onto convex feasible sets

---

## Practical Relevance

These optimization techniques are widely used in real-world scenarios such as:

- **Production planning** and **resource allocation**
- **Portfolio optimization** in finance
- **Scheduling and logistics**
- **Policy modeling** in economics and operations research

This project provides a simplified example of how such problems can be modeled and solved using duality-based optimization.

## Tools

- R programming (base packages)
- Custom implementation of matrix-based optimization algorithms
